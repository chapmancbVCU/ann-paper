    <p class="abstract">This paper presents the idea of implementing 
        artificial neural networks in hardware and the issues involved to get 
        an efficient design.  The discussion will start with a short 
        introduction to neural networks, the algorithms involved, and finally 
        how to put the algorithm in the context of hardware.  In order to put 
        this problem in the context of a software engineering exercise the 
        programming language called VHDL will be used.</p>
